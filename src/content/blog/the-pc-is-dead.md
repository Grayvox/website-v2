When I first read that [37signals](https://37signals.com), a company I both respect and have plenty of grievances with, was launching a line of products with a "pay once, own forever" mindset, I was interested. Are these products all that great? Debatable, but it sent me down a rabbit hole consisting of the dangers of SaaS, big tech monopolies, and even Right to Repair.

And even after all of the research I put into it, one article that was published not even a week ago from writing this still grabbed me by the shirt collar - [The PC is Dead: Itâ€™s Time to Make Computing Personal Again](https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/3292/the-pc-is-dead-its-time-to-make-computing-personal-again).

This is, by far, one of the best articles I've read in a long time. But I'm not here to paraphrase what [Benj Edwards](https://www.benjedwards.com) wrote in it - if you want the context, I expect you to read it yourself. Seriously, you'll thank me later.

What I'm here to do is deliver an honest and true build off of what Edwards says here - the reality of big tech, lightly regulated corporate scenes, anti-repair setups, and lots of subscriptions. It is, in all honesty, just the thing I needed to read - a refresher to hear that despite all the politically charged talk of the current day and age, we still have people talking about problems not a single politician will (or has the guts) to bring up. I promise not to get too political besides that last sentence, but we are going into territory that speaks against what the US government has been letting slide, so be warned.

Now, time for some tech talk.

### No one asked for a subscription

Back in 2017 (It doesn't feel right to say 'way back' yet), Microsoft launched 365 - a subscription based service to be a newer solution to their Office product lineup. Despite the fact that, as of writing, Office 2024 was released just last year and Microsoft is still open to the idea of keeping these iconic apps in a non-subscription solution as well, we all know where this is going. The same way Google kills off a product without much remorse, we'll see the same thing from Microsoft sometime sooner than we might think. Yes, this will upset many, and you might argue that they wouldn't do this for years to come as a result. Except no one asked for Copilot PCs, and we still got those.

Big tech (and basically any big corporation) learned long ago that, while humans can be upset over the loss of a key product they use, it doesn't mean they will drop using the company behind it all together. Because of this, Google has a track record of killing off so many products there is a [graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com) dedicated to it.

While I understand the point of view of many indie hackers and smaller scale companies that feel the subscription services to be able to continously fund their operations, I would like to see a massive shift in the developer community to start building more "buy once, own forever" systems. Besides, you can get consistent revenue still - new major releases can be paid, while minor updates can be included in the purchase. For example, in the case of 37signals, they offer a [Once](https://once.com) product called [Campfire](https://once.com/campfire), which lets you buy the current **version 1**, and then receive all updates that are **1.x** up until they release version 2. This also includes "bare bones support", which as they put it...

Not to say 37signals gets everything right or anything, but I think this mindset helps a lot, especially with tools that would be purchased by more tech savvy users. On the side of things that consider less tech savvy people though, perhaps a more "full" customer support package you can add on as a subscription would make sense.

This can't work for everyone - and subscriptions aren't the enemy exactly, but the sheer amount of predatory behavior large companies use with them needs to stop.
