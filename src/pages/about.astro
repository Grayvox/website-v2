	title="About Me"
	description="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"
>
	<p>
		Home page wasn't enough for you? Honestly I'm glad you're here regardless, because SOMEONE has to read 
		this or it was all for nothing. 😭
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyway... greetings, wanderer of the interwebs. My name is Gray, short for Grayvox. 
		That's not my real name of course, as I prefer some sense of privacy on the interwebs.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm currently working in retail, but am studying Computer Science and Game Development in the hopes of 
		becoming a full time indie dev. Unfortunately, this title doesn't pay the bills well... so the retail job
		helps me financially for now.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most of my projects are freely accessible on my <a href={LINKS.github}>GitHub</a>, except for my games
		which I prefer to keep private. I do have <a href=`${LINKS.github}/godot-fcc-game`>one game</a> publicly 
		available though, which is the first one I
		ever made with Godot.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now onto the organized part! Below you'll find a list of the tech I've used, interests I have (fields of 
		expertise?), and life achievements I've unlocked (somehow).
	</p>
	<p>
		Naturally, we're going to divide this into multipoint lists and special boxes with super cool 
		<code>box-shadow</code> properties tied to them for as much dramatic effect as possible.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ready, dear traveller? LET'S A GO! *Mario pipe noises*
